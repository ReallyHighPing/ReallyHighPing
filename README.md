Hi, I'm  an aspiring cybersecurity professional working toward building hands on experience in the field. My goal is to grow into a dynamic role that bridges both technical and business domains, ultimately transitioning into tech sales and cybersecurity consulting.

I'm currently focused on expanding my knowledge in security tools, threat analysis, and network defense while also developing the communication and strategic skills that will help me thrive in client-facing roles.
